Greetings,
We are Zanzibar Students Union in Sudan (ZASU), amongst us here, we have got so many students studying in different fields including those of health sciences in the bachelor level who are really in need of getting practical training. 
In reference to the above subject, we kindly request you to approve and grant them the opportunity for the practical training at your hospital, as this would definitely boost their career prospects and allow them to practice what they have studied here in college, and thus assist them gain a better understanding in their field of study.
In this year, the following students from International Universityof Africa are asking for the field at Mnazi Mmoja hospital from the 1st of August to 31st of August
